##Zebra_Dialog

A small, compact (one JS file, no dependencies other than jQuery 1.5.2+) and highly configurable dialog box plugin for jQuery meant to replace JavaScript's native "alert" and "confirmation" windows.

Can also be used as a notification widget - when configured to show no buttons and to close automatically - for updates or errors, without distracting users from their browser experience by displaying obtrusive alerts.

##Features

 - great looks - out of the box
 - 5 types of dialog boxes available: confirmation, information, warning, error and question
 - content can also be added through AJAX calls, iFrames or from inline elements
 - easily customizable appearance by changing the CSS file - can be configured so that tabs expand on mouse over;
 - create modal or non-modal dialog boxes - callback functions can be used for further customizations;
 - easily add custom buttons
 - position the dialog box wherever you want - not just in the middle of the screen
 - use callback functions to handle user's choice
 - works in all major browsers (Firefox, Opera, Safari, Chrome, Internet Explorer 6+)
